What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n","   - Python is an easy-to-learn, versatile programming language used in many fields like web development, data science, and automation. It's popular due to its simplicity, readability, large community, and wide range of libraries.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n","   - An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine code at runtime, without the need for compilation.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","   - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as variable names. Examples include if, else, for, while, import, def.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python, as they have special meanings and are reserved for specific purposes in the language.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python ?\n","   - Mutability in Python refers to whether an object’s value can be changed. Mutable objects (e.g., lists) can be modified, while immutable objects (e.g., strings) cannot.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","   - Lists are mutable because they are designed to allow changes (like adding or removing elements), while tuples are immutable to provide safety and faster access, ensuring their contents cannot be altered after creation.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","   - '==' checks if two objects have the same value, while 'is' checks if they are the same object in memory.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n","   - Logical operators in Python are 'and', 'or', and 'not', used to combine or negate conditions.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python ?\n","   - Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type to another, such as converting an integer to a string or a float to an integer. It can be done using functions like 'int()', 'float()', 'str()', etc.\n","\n","10.  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","     - - **Implicit type casting** (or coercion) is done automatically by Python when converting a smaller data type to a larger one (e.g., int to float).\n","     - -  **Explicit type casting** requires the programmer to manually convert one data type to another using functions like 'int()', 'float()', etc.\n","\n","11.  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","     - Conditional statements in Python (like 'if', 'elif', and 'else') allow the program to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions, enabling decision-making in the code.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work ?\n","    - The 'elif' (else if) statement in Python checks an additional condition if the previous 'if' or 'elif' conditions are false, and executes its block of code if the condition is true.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","    - - **For loop**: Repeats a block of code a set number of times, often used with iterables like lists or ranges.\n","    - - **While loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","    - A **while loop** is more suitable when you don't know the number of iterations in advance, such as when waiting for a user to input a valid response or when a condition needs to be met (e.g., waiting for a sensor value to reach a certain threshold)."],"metadata":{"id":"0-l7MQZY16_O"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
